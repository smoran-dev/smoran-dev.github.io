I’m Sean — Data Engineering Manager in Boston. I spend most days building data platforms with Snowflake, dbt, and AWS; nights and weekends are for Jetson tinkering and small AI/LLM experiments.

This blog is my notebook for things that worked (and the things that didn’t) so future-me — and maybe you — can move faster next time.

What to expect:

- ❄️ **Snowflake:** ingestion patterns, modeling, cost & performance tuning
- 🧱 **dbt:** testing strategies, macros, deployments
- 🤖 **AI/LLMs:** small experiments and workflows that actually help
- 🛠️ **Jetson:** edge ML builds, CUDA gotchas, hardware notes

If that sounds useful, **[subscribe](/subscribe/)** and say hi on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanemoran)**.
If you're intersted in my background, you can also skim my **[resume](/resume/)**.
